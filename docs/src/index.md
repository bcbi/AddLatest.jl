# AddLatest

[AddLatest.jl](https://github.com/bcbi/AddLatest.jl)
queries multiple Julia package registries and determines the latest available
version of each package.

This makes it easy to ensure that you are installing the latest version of a
Julia package.

The source code is available in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcbi/AddLatest.jl).
